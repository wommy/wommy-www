	psych
		my psych career is long and winding
		my first introduction to psychology was thru myers briggs

		socionics
			socionics was everything i was looking for

			socionics rationality / irrationality
			replaces mbti's judgment / perception
			mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is a second level dichotomy, static / dynamic
			socionics goes into much greater dtail than myers briggs:
				intertype relations - descriptions of interactions between types
				small groups - common ground between types
				subtypes - no two types are teh same
				model a -
				second level dichotomies
				informational elements
				functions which allow for functional dichotomies
			informationa metabolism - can be simplified as follows: 
			every action you do, is based on information

		horoscopes
			a: the secret language
			my number one to-go-to

			p
				here to can check a birthday
				( check you and a parent )
				and your relationships with other people
				( check an old or current flame )

			cafe astrology

				i personally like their natal chart
				and their relationship chart

		tarot year
			a: heres an easy calculator i just found

			p:
				for example:
				i want to check for my current year
				since my birthday nas not happened yet,
				i check for last year

			a: long descriptions
			a: short description

			a: this site has more descriptions
			but you have to know your number,
			use calc above
