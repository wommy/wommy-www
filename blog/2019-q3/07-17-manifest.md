## a brief history

i started using jekyll in the summer of 2015 right after my father passed.

that previous winter/spring, working for gerald at solution people in chicago, the decision to try something other than wordpress was a gamble that vastly sped up my development: getting more done in three weeks than in three months.

the post wordpress pivot to something now recognized as a static site generator, specifically one called mixture. but it was not to last, as mixture mysteriously folded overnight, taking all its documentation with it. mixture, and its simple gui that provided a discreet layer over extremely simple terminal commands, bridging my confidence, slingshot me into command line. that summer at original graphics printing, my brief experience in mixture, along with my past work in rails, coalesced into the confidence to tackle jekyll, another ruby rooted static site generator.

## technomad: blog publishing software

this site serves as technomad's development documentation. 

each post i write here will serve to document the various steps i took in the software development process.

im looking forward to my first series of posts that are going to follow along as i rebuild wommy.io, the first technomad site. after which, sooner or later, ill strip down jekyll and explain how everything works.
