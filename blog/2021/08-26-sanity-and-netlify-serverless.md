## how i got the POST to work

heres the [commit](https://github.com/wommy/technomad-todo-alpine/commit/90aac2d6619100a10648211e527347fe14b96876) im going off of

so what did i do here

--- i had to change the form

i tried to focus on the `form action` and `method`

- [ ] FIXUP: `action="/api/todo/"`
- [ ] - ? - submit the form thru javascript
- [ ] ...fields
- [ ] RN function > todo
- [ ] export/import sanityClient

the function should

- [ ] pass the document into the client
- [ ] check for errors
- [ ] FIXUP: `event.body.split`
- [ ] ...schema to Form

- [ ] - ? - url based routing ? post does this : get does that
- [ ] redirect: /api/todo /todo/ 301
