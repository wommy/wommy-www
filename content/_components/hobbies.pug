  p my psych career is long and winding
  p 
    | my first introduction to psychology was through 
    a(href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator") myers briggs
  
  //- 
    growing up, 
    the idea of &#39;everyone is equal&#39; was understood as &#39;everyone is the same&#39;
    myers briggs gave me a framework to differentiate people&#39;s reactions
    
    myers briggs ended up being very basic
    it didnt give me the depth that i was seeing
    
    i would spend hours trawling google
    typing in different search terms for interactions i was seeing
    
    the jungian dichotomies ala myers briggs are as follows
    introversion / extraversion
    sensing / intuition
    thinking / feeling
    judgment / perception
    
    jung dichotomy
    
    sharing jungian base

  p hours of trawling google led me to
  h3 socionics
  p socionics was everything i was looking for
  p 
    | socionics' 
    a(href="//wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Rationality_and_irrationality#Typical_characteristics") rationality / irrationality 
    | replaces mbti's judgment / perception
    br
    | mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is instead a second level dichotomy, 
    a(href="//wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Static_and_dynamic#Typical_characteristics") static / dynamic
  
  //- 
    this change made huge changes
    mbti's judgment / perception determines what your extraverted function is
    i never quite got this / it never made sense
    socionics in turn explains it well
    judgment / perception exists in socionics
    but it is a second level dichotomy,
  
  p socionics goes into much greater detail than myers briggs:
