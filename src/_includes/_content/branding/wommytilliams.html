<p>my name has evolved numerous times throughout my life</p>

<p>
  in grade school, all my friends called me tommy
  <br />
  when i got to middle school, i shortened it to tom
</p>

<p>
  i later realized that all my close friends called me tommy
  <br />
  so i switched my facebook name to tommy williams
  <br />
  over night, all the people i barely knew started addressing me as tommy
</p>

<p>
  the newest iteration, wommytilliams came about in college
  <br />
  a bad breakup was causing me to be negative
</p>

<p>
  people started joking that i had some type of alter ego
  <br />
  if tommy williams was dr jekyll, wommy was mr hyde
</p>

<p>
  “wommy” was really taking off
  <br />
  yet it served reference to this aspect of myself i didnt like
  <br />
  so i did the only thing i could and took it back
</p>

<p>
  i bought
  <a href="http://wommytilliams.com">http://wommytilliams.com</a>
</p>

<p>
  wommy tilliams’ uniqueness is a double-edged sword
  <br />
  visually, wommy tilliams is relatively easy to get
  <br />
  auditorily, it sounds like a jarbled nothing
</p>

<p>
  brand wise
  <br />
  if you know tommy williams, wommy tilliams isn’t too hard to get
</p>

<p>if your first move explain your brand,</p>
