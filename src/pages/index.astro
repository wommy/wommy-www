			here i want to list a few words that my design exemplifies

			> simple  
			> concise  
			> clean  
			> eloquent  
			> minimal  
			> transparency

			and a few websites that have inspired me.

			> [facsrv.cdm.depaul.edu/~cmiller/](//facsrv.cdm.depaul.edu/~cmiller/)  
			> - a teacher of mine, one of the first websites i encountered that put [function over form](//ims21.net/web_form_function.htm)

			> [itemsandthings](//itemsandthings.com/)  
			> - one of my favorite music labels. their brand's dedication to minimalism is conveyed thoroughly, from their music to their web design.  
			> - [rework.de](//www.wanna-rework.de/)  
			> - - one of the musicians websites on the above label

			and a few quotes that have inspired me

				my psych career is long and winding

				my first introduction to psychology was through [myers briggs](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)

				<!-- 
					growing up, 
					the idea of &#39;everyone is equal&#39; was understood as &#39;everyone is the same&#39;
					myers briggs gave me a framework to differentiate people&#39;s reactions

					myers briggs ended up being very basic
					it didnt give me the depth that i was seeing

					i would spend hours trawling google
					typing in different search terms for interactions i was seeing

					the jungian dichotomies ala myers briggs are as follows
					introversion / extraversion
					sensing / intuition
					thinking / feeling
					judgment / perception

					jung dichotomy

					sharing jungian base
				-->

				hours of trawling google led me to

				### socionics

				socionics was everything i was looking for

				socionics' [rationality / irrationality](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Rationality_and_irrationality#Typical_characteristics) replaces mbti's judgment / perception  
				mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is instead a second level dichotomy, [static / dynamic](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Static_and_dynamic#Typical_characteristics)

				<!-- 
					this change made huge changes
					mbti's judgment / perception determines what your extraverted function is
					i never quite got this / it never made sense
					socionics in turn explains it well
					judgment / perception exists in socionics
					but it is a second level dichotomy,  
				-->

				socionics goes into much greater detail than myers briggs:

				> [intertype relations](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations) - descriptions of interactions between types  
				> [small groups](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Small_groups) - common ground between types  
				> [subtypes](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Subtypes) - no two types are the same  
				> [model a](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Model_A) -  
				> [second level dichotomies](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Reinin_dichotomies)  
				> [information elements](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_elements)  
				> [functions](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Functions) which allows for [functional dichotomies](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Function_dichotomies)

				<!-- male female differentiations -->

				[information metabolism](//www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_Metabolism) - can be simplied as follows:  
				every action you do, is based on information.

				### horoscopes

				[the secret language](//www.thesecretlanguage.com/today/)  
				my number one to-go-to

				> here you can check [your or anothers birthday](//www.thesecretlanguage.com/check/birthdate/)  
				> ( check you and a parent )  
				> and [your relationships with other people](//www.thesecretlanguage.com/check/relationship/)  
				> ( check an old or current flame )

				[cafe astrology](//astro.cafeastrology.com/)

				> i personally like their [natal chart](//astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/natal)  
				> and their [relationship chart](//astro.cafeastrology.com/cgi-bin/astro/comp2f)

				### tarot year

				[heres a easy calculator i just found](//www.tarotschool.com/Calculator.html)

				> for example:  
				> i want to check for my current year  
				> since my birthday has not happened yet, i check for last year

				[long description](//accessnewage.com/articles/Tarot/lottar2.htm)  
				[short description](//www.cosmictarot.co.uk/discover-your-personal-year-card/)

				[this site has more descriptions](//thetarotroom.com/tarot-growth-cards/)  
				but you have to know your number, use calc above
