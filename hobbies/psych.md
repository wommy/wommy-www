<p>my psych career is long and winding</p>

<p>my first introduction to psychology was through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">myers briggs</a></p>

<!-- 
growing up, 
the idea of &#39;everyone is equal&#39; was understood as &#39;everyone is the same&#39;
myers briggs gave me a framework to differentiate people&#39;s reactions

myers briggs ended up being very basic
it didnt give me the depth that i was seeing

i would spend hours trawling google
typing in different search terms for interactions i was seeing

the jungian dichotomies ala myers briggs are as follows
introversion / extraversion
sensing / intuition
thinking / feeling
judgment / perception

jung dichotomy

sharing jungian base
 -->

<p>hours of trawling google led me to</p>

<h3>socionics</h3>
<p>socionics was everything i was looking for</p>

<p>socionics' <a href="http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Rationality_and_irrationality#Typical_characteristics">rationality / irrationality</a> replaces mbti's judgment / perception<br />
mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is instead a second level dichotomy, <a href="http://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Static_and_dynamic#Typical_characteristics">static / dynamic</a></p>

<!-- this change made huge changes
mbti's judgment / perception determines what your extraverted function is
i never quite got this / it never made sense
socionics in turn explains it well
judgment / perception exists in socionics
but it is a second level dichotomy,  -->

<p>socionics goes into much greater detail than myers briggs:</p>
