        <h2><a href="#wommytilliams">wommytilliams</a></h2>
        <p>my name has evolved numerous times throughout my life</p>
        <p>in grade school, all my friends called me tommy<br>when i got to middle school, i shortened it to tom</p>
        <p>i later realized that all my close friends called me tommy<br>so i switched my facebook name to tommy williams<br>over night, all the people i barely knew started addressing me as tommy</p>
        <p>the newest iteration, wommytilliams came about in college<br>a bad breakup was causing me to be negative</p>
        <p>people started joking that i had some type of alter ego<br>if tommy williams was dr jekyll, wommy was mr hyde</p>
        <p>“wommy” was really taking off<br>yet it served reference to this aspect of myself i didnt like<br>so i did the only thing i could and took it back</p>
        <p>i bought <a href="http://wommytilliams.com">wommytilliams.com</a></p>
        <p>wommy tilliams’ uniqueness is a double-edged sword<br>visually, wommy tilliams is relatively easy to get<br>auditorily, it sounds like a jarbled nothing</p>
        <p>brand wise<br>if you know tommy williams, wommy tilliams isn’t too hard to get</p>
        <p>if your first move  explain your brand, </p>
