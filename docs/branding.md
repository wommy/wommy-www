technomad

my name has evolved numerous times throughout my life

in grade school, all my friends called me tommy  
when i got to middle school, i shortened it to tom

i later realized that all my close friends called me tommy  
so i switched my facebook name to tommy williams  
over night, all the people i barely knew started addressing me as tommy

the newest iteration, wommytilliams came about in college  
a bad breakup was causing me to be negative

people started joking that i had some type of alter ego  
if tommy williams was dr jekyll, wommy was mr hyde

“wommy” was really taking off  
yet it served reference to this aspect of myself i didnt like  
so i did the only thing i could and took it back

i bought [https://wommytilliams.com](https://wommytilliams.com)

wommy tilliams’ uniqueness is a double-edged sword  
visually, wommy tilliams is relatively easy to get  
auditorily, it sounds like a jarbled nothing

brand wise  
if you know tommy williams, wommy tilliams isn’t too hard to get

if your first move explain your brand,
