## psych

my psych career is long and winding

my first introduction to psychology was through [myers briggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)

<!-- 
growing up, 
the idea of &#39;everyone is equal&#39; was understood as &#39;everyone is the same&#39;
myers briggs gave me a framework to differentiate people&#39;s reactions

myers briggs ended up being very basic
it didnt give me the depth that i was seeing

i would spend hours trawling google
typing in different search terms for interactions i was seeing

the jungian dichotomies ala myers briggs are as follows
introversion / extraversion
sensing / intuition
thinking / feeling
judgment / perception

jung dichotomy

sharing jungian base
 -->

hours of trawling google led me to

### socionics

socionics was everything i was looking for

socionics' [rationality / irrationality](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Rationality_and_irrationality#Typical_characteristics) replaces mbti's judgment / perception  
mbti's judgment / perception still exists within socionics, but it is instead a second level dichotomy, [static / dynamic](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Static_and_dynamic#Typical_characteristics)

<!-- this change made huge changes
mbti's judgment / perception determines what your extraverted function is
i never quite got this / it never made sense
socionics in turn explains it well
judgment / perception exists in socionics
but it is a second level dichotomy,  -->

socionics goes into much greater detail than myers briggs:

> [intertype relations](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Intertype_relations) - descriptions of interactions between types  
> [small groups](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Small_groups) - common ground between types  
> [subtypes](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Subtypes) - no two types are the same  
> [model a](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Model_A) -  
> [second level dichotomies](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Reinin_dichotomies)  
> [information elements](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_elements)  
> [functions](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Functions) which allows for [functional dichotomies](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Function_dichotomies)

<!-- male female differentiations -->

[information metabolism](https://www.wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=Information_Metabolism) - can be simplied as follows:  
every action you do, is based on information.

### horoscopes
