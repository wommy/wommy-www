## film//play

the **Detroit Culture Club** contacted me  
to create a website  
for their latest event **film//play**

> [filmPlayDetroit.technomad.media](https://filmplaydetroit.technomad.media/)

i offered to create a digital respository  
a hub for their digital content and contact info  
but they just wanted a description  
so thats what i delivered

now that we've gotten to know each other  
i feel confident pushing for a more interactive user experience
